How to run:
POST:
python web_service.py in one window
curl -X POST -d 'fragments=put_fragments_here' http://localhost:8080/assemble

Fragments should be new line separated (of string fragments that are the input)


Via command line:
1:
python assembleText.py
enter your fragments
control D to indicate done entering fragments

2:
python assembleText.py your_file_here.txt

General notes:
web_service.py contains the code that does task 2. assemble_text.py contains the code that does task 1.
I was not able to get this to run with either the Shakespeare or Lorem Ipsum files, because it appears that these do not have a minimum overlap of 3 from each of the fragments.
The output contains a list of partially-assembled fragments that are individually correct.
